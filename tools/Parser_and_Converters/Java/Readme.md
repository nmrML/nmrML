## Generate Java bindings from .XSD file 

One way to generate the Java bindings from `.xsd` files is to use the tool `xjc` provided by the latest JDK.

The classes in package `org.nmrml.schema` where generated by running the following command:

```
$ xjc -d src/main/java/ xsd/nmrML.xsd
```

More details how to run `xjc` can be found [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/xjc.html).

## Unit Tests

In order to run the unit tests one needs first to symbolic link the folder containing the reference spectra _bmse000325_.
 
```
$ ln -rs ../../../examples/reference_spectra_examples/bmrb/bmse000325.fid/ \
 src/main/resources/org/nmrml/example/reference_spectra_example/
```

To run the tests, one can run the following command:

```
$ mvn test
```

## Build and Package

The library `nmrml-1.0.rc1.jar` can be built and packaged using the command:
  
```
$ mvn package
```
