It has improved signal/noise (S/N) ratios obtained by reducing the operating temperature of the coil and the pre-amplifier. As a result, the efficiency of the coil is improved and the noise of the coil and the pre-amplifier are reduced.The dramatic increase in the S/N ratio by a factor of 3-4, as compared to conventional probes, leads to a possible reduction in experiment time of up to 16 or a reduction in required sample concentration by a factor of up to 4. The CryoProbes possess key characteristics for NMR analysis:
Significant S/N gains (with moderately salty samples also)
Short pulse widths
Short ring down times
Linear behavior in power response
Gradient capability
CryoProbes are available as Triple Resonance, Dual, Selective X Detection, MicroImaging, and Quad Nucleus Probes configurations at 400 MHz and higher
All high resolution probes have a lock circuit
All high resolution probes have Z-gradient
