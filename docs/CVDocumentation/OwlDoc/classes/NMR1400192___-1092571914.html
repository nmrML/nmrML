The correct solution is a gradient, such that the field varies along the spinner axis. This so-called Magic Angle Gradient is employed in Bruker’s high resolution Magic Angle Spinning (hr-MAS) probes, and is implemented in such a way that it is compatible with the stator and does not interfere with the sample eject/insert. Bruker BioSpin has developed a series of dedicated probes for standard bore magnets to accommodate the rapidly expanding field of hr-MAS. These probes are available in double (e.g. 1H and 13C) and triple resonance (e.g., 1H, 13C, 15N) modes and come equipped with a deuterium lock channel. The probes have automatic sample ejection and insertion capability, with the availability of an optional sample changer, enabling fully automated sample runs. Probes can be equipped with an optional B0 gradient, directed along the magic angle, so that gradient spectroscopy can be done used.

altdef: High resolution MAS (hr-MAS) provides an easy means of obtaining high resolution spectra for a variety of samples that would otherwise result in poorly resolved spectra. The addition of an hr-MAS probe and a MAS pneumatic unit to a standard high resolution spectrometer is all that is needed to open the gate to the world of hr-MAS spectroscopy and gain access to a vast amount of highly interesting samples.
