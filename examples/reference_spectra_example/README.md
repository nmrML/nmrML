### Overview

This spectra is one of the reference spectra created by The Human Metabolome
Project (University of Alberta) as part of a project cataloguing all detectable
metabolites in the human metabolome. The spectra is refererence 1H NMR spectra
of 2-Ketobutyric acid. The sample was collected at a concentration of 50 mM at
pH 7.0 in H<sub>2</sub>O and refereced to DSS and was collected on a Varian 500
MHz Inova Spectrometer using the first transient of the tnnoesy-presaturation
pulse sequence.

### Overview
Metabolome analyses were performed at the Metabolome Facility of Bordeaux, using quantitative proton NMR ( 1H-NMR) profiling of  polar extracts. Polar metabolites were extracted on lyophilized powder (50 mg DW per biological replicate) with an ethanol–water series at 80 °C. The lyophilized extracts were titrated to pH 6 and lyophilized again. Each dried titrated extract was solubilized in 0.5 ml of D O with tri-methylsilyl-propionic-2,2,3,3-d  acid (TSP) sodium salt (0.01% final concentration) for chemical shift calibration and EDTA (5 mM final concentration for the CE and 2 mM for the OR stage). H-NMR spectra were recorded at 500.162 MHz on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) using an ATMA inverse weight basis to be comparable. All the analyses were performed 5 mm probe flushed with nitrogen gas and an electronic reference for quantification (ERETIC2). Sixty-four scans of  32 000 data points each were acquired with a 90 ° pulse angle, a 6000 Hz spectral width, a 2.73 s acquisition time, and a 25 s recycle delay.
