Harmonize
Version in CV and in xml:
<cv fullName="nmrML Controlled Vocabulary" version="0.0.1" id="ID001"<!--put NMRCV --> URI="http://www.nmrml.org/nmrml-cv.0.0.1.owl"/>

For annotation CV terms get indication on useful generalisations, i.e. what more general superclasses of a term would help users in finding more but still relevant results ?

Rules to enforce MI via semantic validator:
E.g. The instrument description needs to specyfy CV terms under NMR Instrument (for fixed standard Instrument setups as provided by a vendor as one set) OR NMR console AND NMR Magnet (for more propreitary setups and Hardware configurations)
